# CG-OAMP-NET

## Introduction
This repository contains an implementation of the conjugate gradient (CG)-based OAMP-NET [1, 2], which utilizes the CG method to avoid the matrix inverse in OAMP iterations and improves the original OAMP through deep learning. 

## Requirements
- Python (>= 3.6)
- Tensorflow (>=2.3.0)
- numpy (>=1.18.5)
- scipy (>=1.4.1)

## Datasets
WINNER II datasets in [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EAeylbdQUQWOUVrinGhK24zBc_JeRzoN?usp=sharing)
